## starting the project 🏃
During the initial stages of the project, I quickly sketched out an inspiration and hi-fi draft. I got the idea to create a sort of GitHub ticket website where users should be able to log in and go to their dashboard to see all their tickets or open projects, just like you can on GitHub. Following that, I immediately delved into VS Code.
Next, I researched how to implement the React Router in React, which I eventually figured out and applied. I then documented this in my wiki.

Afterward, I started building pages and components. I struggled a bit with the header component because I made a few errors with the BrowserRouter, but eventually, I understood what was going wrong. I eventually fixed it and got it to work.


Finally, I attempted to create the login function.

## final product 🎩

The final product I produced has been deployed live using Vercel. You can navigate through different pages using the menu.
The different pages are:
- /login
- /dashboard
- /home
- /

Unfortunately, I couldn't manage to create pages that are only accessible upon logging in. This was new to me, but it was interesting to try it out.
