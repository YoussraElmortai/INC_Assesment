## Working on project 🏃
### start
During the initial stages of the project, I quickly sketched out an inspiration and hi-fi draft. I got the idea to create a sort of GitHub ticket website where users should be able to log in and go to their dashboard to see all their tickets or open projects, just like you can on GitHub. Following that, I immediately delved into VS Code.
Next, I researched how to implement yarn and the React Router in React, which I eventually figured out and applied. I then documented this in my wiki.
### building
I started building pages and components. I installed the react-router-dom using Yarn. I struggled a bit with the header component because I made a few errors with the BrowserRouter. However, after some digging on the internet and delving into the documentation on the react router, I eventually understood what was going wrong and got the router to work. Wich let me go to different pages on my project.
Then, I created the login page with its login component, and that was the last thing I built before cleaning up a bit of my code and making sure i was happy with the result.

## final product 🎩

The final product I produced has been deployed live using Vercel. You can navigate through different pages using the menu.
The different pages are:
- /login
- /dashboard
- /home
- /
  
Unfortunately, I couldn't manage to create pages that are only accessible upon logging in. This was new to me, but it was interesting to try out.
I did use states to render the home page if you correctly fill in the form.

## tests 🚧

I've run some tests and documented everything in my [wiki](https://github.com/YoussraElmortai/unc-inc-opdracht/wiki/5.-Testen-%F0%9F%A7%AA)
. I started by making sure the webpage looks good on mobile screens first. Then, I checked if you can smoothly navigate through the project by tabbing through it.
