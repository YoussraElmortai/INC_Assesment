## starting the project 🏃
During the initial stages of the project, I quickly sketched out an inspiration and high-fidelity draft. Following that, I immediately delved into VS Code.
Next, I researched how to implement the React Router in React, which I eventually figured out and applied. I then documented this in my wiki.

Afterward, I started building pages and components. I struggled a bit with the header component because I made a few errors with the BrowserRouter, but eventually, I understood what was going wrong. I eventually fixed it and got it to work.

Finally, I attempted to create the login function.

## final product 🎩

The final product I produced has been deployed live using Vercel. You can navigate through different pages using the menu.
The different pages are:
- /login
- /dashboard
- /home
- /
